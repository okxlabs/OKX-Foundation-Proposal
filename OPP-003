## Proposal Summary

**Core Objective**: Establish comprehensive governance framework for Universal Token Locking System to provide secure, permissionless token locking infrastructure supporting both ERC20 tokens and native ETH across the Boost ecosystem

**Expected Outcomes**: Standardized token locking mechanism, enhanced security for time-locked assets, improved DeFi protocol integration capabilities, activity-based asset management system

**Implementation Timeline**: 1 month from proposal approval

---
## Governance Status Analysis

### Current Pain Points
- **Issue 1**: Lack of standardized token locking infrastructure for ecosystem projects requiring time-locked asset management
- **Issue 2**: Security vulnerabilities in custom locking implementations across different protocols
- **Issue 3**: Inefficient gas consumption and limited functionality in existing locking solutions
- **Issue 4**: No unified system for managing locked assets across multiple activities and protocols
  
### Improvement Necessity
- **Security Requirements**: Need for audited, battle-tested locking infrastructure to prevent asset loss
- **Ecosystem Integration**: Growing demand for standardized locking mechanisms in DeFi protocols, vesting schedules, and governance systems
- **Technical Advancement**: Modern smart contract patterns and gas optimization techniques can significantly improve user experience
- **Compliance Needs**: Regulatory requirements for transparent and verifiable asset locking mechanisms

## Specific Governance Changes

### Change Type
- [x] Infrastructure Innovation

### Detailed Change Content

#### Universal Token Locking Framework

**New Clause**:
> Universal Token Locking Framework shall establish the following core principles:
> 1. All token locking operations must support both ERC20 tokens and native ETH through unified interface
> 2. Activity-based management system must be implemented using bytes32 keys for organizational flexibility
> 3. Lock duration constraints must be enforced (1 second minimum, 1 year maximum)
> 4. Reentrancy protection and secure transfer patterns must be mandatory for all operations
> 5. Gas-optimized storage layout must be used to minimize transaction costs
  
**Explanation**:
This framework ensures consistent, secure, and efficient token locking capabilities across all Boost ecosystem projects while maintaining flexibility for diverse use cases.

#### Security and Operational Standards

**New Clause**:
> Security and Operational Standards for Universal Token Locking:
> 1. All locking contracts must implement OpenZeppelin ReentrancyGuard protection
> 2. Native ETH transfers must implement secure patterns to prevent reentrancy attacks
> 3. Checks-Interactions-Effects pattern must be followed in all state-changing functions
> 4. Storage optimization must achieve single-slot packing for lock information
> 5. Emergency mechanisms and proper error handling must be implemented
> 6. Comprehensive event logging must be available for all lock/unlock operations
  
**Explanation**:
These standards ensure maximum security, gas efficiency, and operational transparency for all token locking operations.

#### Integration and Compatibility Requirements

**New Clause**:
> Integration and Compatibility Requirements:
> 1. Locking system must be permissionless and accessible to all ecosystem participants
> 2. Multiple concurrent locks per user must be supported with different activity keys
> 3. Lock information must be publicly queryable with comprehensive status reporting
> 4. Integration APIs must be standardized for easy adoption by ecosystem projects
> 5. Backward compatibility must be maintained for future upgrades
  
**Explanation**:
These requirements ensure the locking system can serve as foundational infrastructure for the entire Boost ecosystem.

## Technical Specifications

### Core Features
- Universal Token Support: ERC20 tokens and native ETH through unified interface
- Activity-Based Management: Flexible organization using bytes32 activity keys
- Optimized Storage: Single storage slot per lock (128-bit amount + 64-bit duration + 64-bit start time)
- Security Patterns: ReentrancyGuard + Checks-Interactions-Effects + secure transfer patterns
- Flexible Duration: 1 second to 1 year lock periods with precise timestamp control
  
### Gas Optimization
- Single storage slot packing reduces SSTORE costs by ~15,000 gas per lock
- Efficient mapping structure minimizes storage reads
- Optimized event emission for comprehensive logging with minimal overhead
- Simplified native ETH transfers without gas restrictions for improved compatibility
  
### Security Measures
- OpenZeppelin ReentrancyGuard protection against reentrancy attacks
- Secure native ETH transfers with proper error handling and success validation
- Comprehensive input validation and custom error handling for gas efficiency
- Secure deletion of storage after successful unlocks to prevent state inconsistencies
- Checks-Interactions-Effects pattern implementation for maximum security
