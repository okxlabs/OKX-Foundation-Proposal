## Proposal Summary

**Core Objective**: Establish comprehensive funding framework for professional security audits of new version smart contracts to significantly enhance on-chain security and user asset protection

**Expected Outcomes**: Enhanced contract security through professional audits, reduced vulnerability risks, increased user confidence, improved ecosystem security standards

---

## Governance Status Analysis

### Current Pain Points
- **Issue 1**: Lack of dedicated funding for comprehensive security audits of new contract versions
- **Issue 2**: Limited resources for professional security assessment of critical smart contracts
- **Issue 3**: Potential security vulnerabilities in unaudited contract deployments
- **Issue 4**: Insufficient security validation for complex DeFi protocol integrations

### Improvement Necessity
- **Security Requirements**: Need for professional security audits to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities before mainnet deployment
- **User Protection**: Community assets require maximum security validation through expert third-party assessment
- **Ecosystem Trust**: Professional audits enhance ecosystem credibility and user confidence
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Transparent security validation supports regulatory compliance and institutional adoption

## Specific Governance Changes

### Change Type
- [x] Security Enhancement

### Detailed Change Content

#### Security Audit Funding Framework

**New Clause**:
> The Security Audit Funding Framework shall establish the following principles:
> 1. All new version smart contracts must undergo professional security audits before mainnet deployment
> 2. Audit funding must be allocated from community treasury or dedicated security fund
> 3. Audit scope must cover all critical functions including token locking, distribution, and governance mechanisms
> 4. Audit reports must be publicly available and include detailed vulnerability assessments
> 5. Remediation of identified issues must be completed before contract deployment

**Explanation**:
This framework ensures comprehensive security validation for all critical smart contracts, protecting user assets and maintaining ecosystem integrity.

#### Professional Audit Standards

**New Clause**:
> Professional Audit Standards for Smart Contract Security:
> 1. Audits must be conducted by certified security firms with proven DeFi expertise
> 2. Audit scope must include manual code review, automated testing, and formal verification
> 3. Critical and high-severity vulnerabilities must be identified and resolved
> 4. Audit timeline must allow sufficient time for thorough assessment (minimum 2-4 weeks)
> 5. Follow-up audits must be conducted for significant contract modifications

**Explanation**:
These standards ensure maximum security validation through professional expertise and comprehensive assessment methodologies.

#### Community Funding Mechanism

**New Clause**:
> Community Funding Mechanism for Security Audits:
> 1. Audit funding must be transparent and community-accessible
> 2. Funding allocation must be proportional to contract complexity and risk level
> 3. Multiple audit firms should be considered for critical contracts
> 4. Community voting must approve significant audit funding allocations
> 5. Audit cost-benefit analysis must be publicly documented

**Explanation**:
These mechanisms ensure transparent and efficient allocation of community resources for maximum security benefit.

## Implementation Roadmap

| Phase | Timeline | Key Tasks | Responsible Party | Deliverables | Success Criteria |
|-------|----------|-----------|-------------------|--------------|------------------|
| **Preparation Phase** | M1 | Audit firm selection, contract preparation, funding allocation | Core Team + Security Team | Selected audit firms, prepared contracts, allocated budget | Community approval >70% |
| **Audit Phase** | M1-M2 | Professional security assessment, vulnerability identification | External Auditors | Comprehensive audit reports, vulnerability assessments | Zero critical vulnerabilities |
| **Remediation Phase** | M2-M3 | Vulnerability fixes, code improvements, re-audit if needed | Development Team | Fixed contracts, updated documentation | All high/critical issues resolved |
| **Deployment Phase** | M3-M4 | Audited contract deployment, security documentation | Operations Team | Live audited contracts, security reports | Successful deployment, community confidence >85% |

## Community Impact Assessment

| Stakeholders | Impact Analysis | Impact Level | Mitigation Measures | Responsible Party |
|--------------|-----------------|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Contract Users** | Enhanced security for locked assets, reduced risk of exploits | Highly Positive | Transparent audit reports, security documentation | Security Team |
| **Token Holders** | Improved asset protection, increased confidence in ecosystem | Positive | Regular security updates, incident response plans | Community Manager |
| **Developers** | Higher security standards, reduced development risks | Positive | Security best practices, audit guidelines | Technical Committee |
| **Ecosystem Projects** | Enhanced security standards, improved reputation | Positive | Security templates, audit recommendations | Development Team |

---

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-------------|--------|-------------------|
| Audit cost overrun | Medium | Medium | Fixed-price contracts, multiple vendor quotes |
| Audit timeline delays | Medium | Medium | Buffer time allocation, parallel audit tracks |
| Incomplete vulnerability coverage | Low | High | Multiple audit firms, comprehensive scope definition |
| Community funding resistance | Low | Medium | Clear cost-benefit analysis, transparent reporting |
