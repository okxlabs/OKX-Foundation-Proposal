## Proposal Summary

**Core Objective**: Establish comprehensive smart contract pause mechanism to enable rapid response and risk mitigation when contracts are under attack or experience operational errors that impact functionality or asset security

**Expected Outcomes**: Enhanced risk response capability, reduced potential asset losses, improved contract security management, standardized emergency response procedures

---

## Governance Status Analysis

### Current Pain Points
- **Issue 1**: High frequency of hacking incidents in Web3 space with continuously evolving attack methods
- **Issue 2**: Smart contracts are difficult to modify once deployed, lacking rapid mitigation measures during attacks
- **Issue 3**: Absence of standardized pause mechanism leads to potential irreversible asset losses during security incidents
- **Issue 4**: No clear governance framework for emergency contract suspension decisions

### Improvement Necessity
- **Security Requirements**: Need for rapid response mechanism to protect user assets during attacks or operational errors
- **Risk Management**: Critical need to minimize potential losses through timely contract suspension capabilities
- **Technical Development**: OKX Labs requires designed and implemented contract pause mechanism to improve risk response ability and efficiency
- **Community Protection**: Enhanced security measures to protect ecosystem participants from evolving threats

## Specific Governance Changes

### Change Type
- [x] Mechanism Innovation
- [x] Security Enhancement

### Detailed Change Content

#### Smart Contract Pause Conditions

**New Clause**:
> Smart Contract Pause Conditions:
> 1. Contracts may be paused when under active attack that threatens functionality or asset security
> 2. Contracts may be paused when experiencing operational errors that impact functionality or asset security
> 3. Pause decisions must prioritize user asset protection and security
> 4. All pause actions must be documented and publicly transparent

**Explanation**:
These conditions establish clear criteria for when contract suspension is warranted, ensuring rapid response to security threats while maintaining transparency.

#### Pause Mechanism Framework

**New Clause**:
> Smart Contract Pause Mechanism Framework:
> 1. **Security Organization-Triggered Pause**: Authorized security organizations may trigger pause when monitoring detects attacks or operational errors meeting pause criteria
> 2. **Community Proposal-Triggered Pause**: Any eligible Foundation member may submit a proposal to pause contracts, which triggers pause upon passing governance vote
> 3. Both mechanisms must specify target contract and pause duration
> 4. All pause actions must be recorded on-chain for transparency

**Explanation**:
This framework provides dual pathways for contract suspension, enabling both rapid response by security experts and community-driven emergency actions.

#### Security Organization-Triggered Pause

**New Clause**:
> Security Organization-Triggered Pause Procedures:
> 1. **Authorized Parties**: Only security organizations with partnership agreements with the Foundation may trigger pauses when attacks or operational errors meeting pause criteria are detected
> 2. **Standard Pause Duration**: Default pause duration is 24 hours (subject to review and adjustment)
> 3. **Extension**: Pause extensions must be approved through proposal vote to prolong the pause period
> 4. **Early Termination**: If special conditions require early termination, it may be executed after proposal and vote approval
> 5. All security organization pause actions must be immediately reported to governance committee

**Explanation**:
This mechanism enables rapid response by trusted security partners while maintaining governance oversight through extension and termination procedures.

#### Community Proposal-Triggered Pause

**New Clause**:
> Community Proposal-Triggered Pause Procedures:
> 1. **Eligible Initiators**: Any member entity, individual, or party within the Foundation may submit a pause proposal upon identifying attacks or operational errors meeting pause criteria
> 2. **Proposal Requirements**: Proposals must specify target contract and proposed pause duration
> 3. **Trigger Condition**: Pause is triggered when proposal passes governance vote
> 4. **Extension**: Pause extensions must be approved through proposal vote to prolong the pause period
> 5. **Early Termination**: If special conditions require early termination, it may be executed after proposal and vote approval

**Explanation**:
This mechanism empowers community members to initiate emergency responses through democratic governance processes, ensuring broad participation in security decisions.
