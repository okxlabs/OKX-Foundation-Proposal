## Proposal Summary

**Core Objective**: Establish comprehensive smart contract pause mechanism to enable rapid response and risk mitigation when contracts are under attack or experience operational errors that impact functionality or asset security

**Expected Outcomes**: Enhanced risk response capability, reduced potential asset losses, improved contract security management, standardized emergency response procedures

---

## Governance Status Analysis

### Current Pain Points
- **Issue 1**: High frequency of hacking incidents in Web3 space with continuously evolving attack methods
- **Issue 2**: Smart contracts are difficult to modify once deployed, lacking rapid mitigation measures during attacks
- **Issue 3**: Absence of standardized pause mechanism leads to potential irreversible asset losses during security incidents
- **Issue 4**: No clear governance framework for emergency contract suspension decisions

### Improvement Necessity
- **Security Requirements**: Need for rapid response mechanism to protect user assets during attacks or operational errors
- **Risk Management**: Critical need to minimize potential losses through timely contract suspension capabilities
- **Technical Development**: OKX Labs requires designed and implemented contract pause mechanism to improve risk response ability and efficiency
- **Community Protection**: Enhanced security measures to protect ecosystem participants from evolving threats

## Specific Governance Changes

### Change Type
- [x] Mechanism Innovation
- [x] Security Enhancement

### Detailed Change Content

#### Smart Contract Pause Conditions

**New Clause**:
> Smart Contract Pause Conditions:
> 1. Contracts may be paused when under active attack that threatens functionality or asset security
> 2. Contracts may be paused when experiencing operational errors that impact functionality or asset security
> 3. Pause decisions must prioritize user asset protection and security
> 4. All pause actions must be documented and publicly transparent

**Explanation**:
These conditions establish clear criteria for when contract suspension is warranted, ensuring rapid response to security threats while maintaining transparency.

#### Pause Mechanism Framework

**New Clause**:
> Smart Contract Pause Mechanism Framework:
> 1. **Reporter-Triggered Pause**: Authorized Reporters may trigger pause when monitoring detects attacks or operational errors meeting pause criteria, with automatic 24-hour recovery
> 2. **Owner-Triggered Pause**: Owner (Foundation) may pause contracts through proposal and voting process, with configurable duration
> 3. All pause actions must specify target contract
> 4. All pause actions must be recorded on-chain for transparency
> 5. Reporter pauses automatically expire after 24 hours unless extended by Owner through governance

**Explanation**:
This framework provides dual pathways for contract suspension: rapid response by Reporters with automatic recovery, and governance-controlled actions by Owner with flexible duration management.

#### Reporter-Triggered Pause Procedures

**New Clause**:
> Reporter-Triggered Pause Procedures:
> 1. **Authorized Parties**: Only Reporters added by Owner through proposal and voting may trigger pauses when attacks or operational errors meeting pause criteria are detected
> 2. **Automatic Pause Duration**: Reporter-triggered pauses are automatically set to 24 hours
> 3. **Automatic Recovery**: Contracts automatically resume after 24 hours unless Owner extends the pause through governance
> 4. **Risk Assessment Period**: During the 24-hour pause, Foundation assesses risks based on detection reports
> 5. **Extension Process**: If risk assessment indicates continued threat, Owner must submit proposal to extend pause beyond 24 hours
> 6. **Early Termination**: Owner may terminate pause early through proposal and vote approval if conditions allow
> 7. All Reporter pause actions must be immediately reported and logged on-chain

**Explanation**:
This mechanism enables rapid response by authorized Reporters with automatic recovery safeguards, providing immediate protection while allowing Foundation time for risk assessment and informed decision-making.

#### Owner-Triggered Pause Procedures

**New Clause**:
> Owner-Triggered Pause Procedures:
> 1. **Authorized Party**: Only Owner (Foundation) may initiate pause through proposal and voting process
> 2. **Proposal Requirements**: Proposals must specify target contract and proposed pause duration
> 3. **Trigger Condition**: Pause is triggered when proposal passes governance vote
> 4. **Duration Management**: Owner can set custom pause duration through governance vote
> 5. **Extension**: Pause extensions must be approved through proposal vote to prolong the pause period
> 6. **Resume**: Owner can resume contracts through proposal and vote approval
> 7. All Owner pause actions require governance approval and are recorded on-chain

**Explanation**:
This mechanism provides Foundation with governance-controlled pause capabilities, ensuring democratic oversight and flexible duration management for complex security situations.

#### Core Mechanism: Role-Based Access Control

**New Clause**:
> Core Mechanism - Role-Based Access Control:
> 
> The pause mechanism implements a two-role system with distinct responsibilities:
> 
> **Owner Role (Foundation)**:
> 1. There is only one Owner, managed by the Foundation
> 2. Owner can add or remove Reporter roles through proposal and voting process
> 3. Owner can pause or resume contracts through proposal and voting process
> 4. All Owner actions require governance approval via proposal and vote
> 5. Owner has ultimate authority over contract pause/resume operations
> 
> **Reporter Role**:
> 1. Reporters can pause contracts when security threats or operational errors are detected
> 2. When a Reporter pauses a contract, the pause duration is automatically set to 24 hours
> 3. After 24 hours, the contract automatically resumes unless extended by Owner through governance
> 4. During the 24-hour pause period, Foundation will assess risk based on detection reports
> 5. Foundation may extend the pause or take additional actions based on risk assessment
> 6. Reporters cannot resume contracts; only Owner can resume through governance vote
> 
> **Automatic Recovery Mechanism**:
> 1. Reporter-triggered pauses automatically expire after 24 hours
> 2. Foundation must complete risk assessment within the 24-hour window
> 3. If risk assessment indicates continued threat, Owner must submit proposal to extend pause
> 4. If no extension proposal is passed, contract automatically resumes after 24 hours

**Explanation**:
This role-based mechanism provides a balanced approach to emergency response: Reporters enable rapid response to immediate threats with automatic recovery, while Owner maintains governance oversight and ultimate control through democratic processes. The 24-hour automatic recovery ensures contracts are not indefinitely paused while providing sufficient time for risk assessment.
